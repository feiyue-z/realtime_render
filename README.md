# Realtime 3D Rendering
## Description
In this project for a Computer Graphics course,   OpenGL is used to render 3D images to support camera movement.
## Getting Started
Qt and QtCreator are required to run the program.
## Usage

Click `Upload Scene File` to choose a scene to render. Scene files can be found in `/scenefiles`.<br>
Tessellation parameters and camera clip planes can be adjusted using sliders on the left.<br>
For translational movement, use `W`, `S`, `A`, and `D` to move in 4 different directions, use `Space` and `Ctrl` to move up and down.<br>
Simply use your mouse to drag around for rotational movement.

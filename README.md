Click `Upload Scene File` to choose a scene to render. Scene files can be found in `/scenefiles`.<br>
Tessellation parameters and camera clip planes can be adjusted using sliders on the left.<br>
For translational movement, use `W`, `S`, `A`, and `D` to move in 4 different directions, use `Space` and `Ctrl` to move up and down.<br>
Simply use your mouse to drag around for rotational movement.
